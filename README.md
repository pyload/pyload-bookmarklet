Notes:
------
- This bookmarklet has three methods to submit links to pyLoad, you have to choose one.
- All methods have pros and cons:
  - Method 1 - links are sent via http://<pyload_host>/flash/add
    - pros:
      1. This method does not require you to be logged in to the pyLoad web interface.
      2. No user and password is sent over the network.
    - cons:
      1. The links are sent to the *collector*, not to the *queue*.
  - Method 2 - links are sent via http://<pyload_host>/api/addPackage
    - pros:
      1. The downloads start immediately.
    - cons:
      1. You must be already logged in to the pyLoad web interface for this method to work.
  - Method 3 - links are sent via http://<pyload_host>/api/addPackage using username & password
    - pros:
      1. The downloads start immediately.
      2. You don't have to be logged in to the pyLoad web interface for this method to work...
    - cons:
      1. Username & password is sent with the request, so you'd better use this method over a secured connection (HTTPS).
      2. This method requires you to have [api_app.py@576baf2](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/576baf2d66b9dd1b228f121df44ff01b45d732f4) commit applied to *api_app.py*
- If the page where the download is located uses HTTPS and pyLoad uses HTTP, you will get a security warning, and you have to confirm the send.<br/>
Nowadays that most web pages uses HTTPS, it is recommended to configure pyLoad to also use HTTPS - You will avoid this security warning and also if you use submit method 3, the user and password are sent over a secured channel.
